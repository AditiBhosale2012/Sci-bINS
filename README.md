# Smart-Bins✨⭐

It is an IOT based project intended to make the environment healthy and clean by incorporating technology in it. 
System will be used for proper monitoring and disposal of garbage 
by measuring the garbage level in real time and alerting the Garbage collection team when the 
bins are full. The system will also display in how much time the Garbage collection vans will 
come and collect the garbage. And if not cleaned, will send a complaint message to the higher 
authority.
